# 🛡️ Python-Based Port Scanner (GUI)

A Python-based GUI port scanner built for educational and ethical hacking purposes.  
This application scans a target host for open TCP ports and displays the results in a clean desktop interface.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Port scanning is a core concept in network reconnaissance and cybersecurity.  
This project demonstrates how open ports can be identified on a system and how such information helps understand exposed network services.

This tool is intended strictly for learning and ethical security testing.

## ✨ Features

- GUI-based desktop application
- Scans a target host (e.g., localhost)
- Default port range: 1–1024
- Displays open ports clearly
- Identifies common services using port numbers
- Simple and user-friendly interface

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Attempts TCP connections to ports in a specified range
- Successful connections are marked as OPEN
- Known port numbers are mapped to common services
- Results are displayed directly in the GUI
